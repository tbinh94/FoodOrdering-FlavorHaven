The project is written in C# and uses SQL Server as database.

To use Project, run the foodordering.sln file in the foodordering folder. Images are stored in Resources.

NOTE: Add the ScriptDatabase.sql file because I forgot to zip it when submitting Google Form, run the .sql file in SSMS before using Project.
